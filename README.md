## Versioning System

`1.0.0` - `r.l.s`

**`r increments by 1`**, **`l increments by 25`**,<br>
**`s increments by 25`**

- Once `s = 100`, **`s resets to 0`**, and **`l increments by 25`**
- Once `l = 100`, **`l resets to 0`**, and **`r increments by 1`**

**Summary**:<br>
&emsp;After `1.75.75`, the next small update should be `2.0` (not `1.75.100`), because when `l = 100`, `r` increments to `2`, and `l` resets to `0`
